# Hardhat Template

This has the hardhat packages and configuration I like to use.

It uses prettier and solhint for linting and typechain to generate TS classes for contracts.

## Set up

See .env.example for environment configuration variables.

Be sure to change the package name in package.json and run `rm -rf .git`.
